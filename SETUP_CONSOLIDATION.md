# Setup Script Consolidation

## Overview

I've consolidated `initial_setup.sh` and `configuration_files.sh` into a single, more efficient `setup.sh` script that provides all the functionality of both original scripts with significant improvements.

## ✅ **Consolidated Features**

### From `initial_setup.sh`:
- ✅ System package installation via requirements.txt
- ✅ Directory creation and permissions setup  
- ✅ User group management (docker, sudo)
- ✅ pyenv installation and configuration
- ✅ Go installation (latest version with architecture detection)
- ✅ Rust/Rustup installation (latest stable with components)
- ✅ Go tools installation (asdf, pdtm)
- ✅ System configuration (sysctl for arsenal)

### From `configuration_files.sh`:
- ✅ Configuration file copying with backup
- ✅ Shell detection (zsh/bash) and appropriate config deployment
- ✅ Oh My Zsh installation and theme deployment (ZSH users)
- ✅ asdf and Node.js setup
- ✅ npm package installation
- ✅ pdtm installation and initialization
- ✅ PATH management

## 🚀 **New Improvements**

### 1. **Enhanced Command Line Interface**
```bash
# Basic setup (all features)
./setup.sh

# Skip system package installation
./setup.sh --skip-packages

# Skip configuration file deployment
./setup.sh --skip-config

# Force overwrite existing config files
./setup.sh --force

# Show help
./setup.sh --help
```

### 2. **Better Error Handling & Recovery**
- **Graceful failures**: Continues processing even if individual operations fail
- **Operation tracking**: Maintains arrays of successful/failed/skipped operations
- **Backup creation**: Automatically backs up existing configuration files
- **Recovery suggestions**: Provides actionable advice for failed operations

### 3. **Enhanced File Management**
- **Backup system**: Creates timestamped backups before overwriting
- **Directory creation**: Safely creates missing directories
- **Permission handling**: Proper ownership and permissions for /opt directories
- **Validation**: Checks file existence before operations

### 4. **Improved User Experience**
- **Progress indicators**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Comprehensive summary**: Shows what succeeded, failed, or was skipped
- **Colored output**: Green/red/yellow indicators for easy scanning
- **Clear logging**: Detailed logs with timestamps

### 5. **Modular Design**
- **Phase-based execution**: Logical separation of setup phases
- **Conditional execution**: Skip phases based on command line arguments
- **Dependency checking**: Verifies tools exist before using them

### 6. **Latest Version Installation**
- **Go**: Automatically fetches and installs the latest Go version
  - Multi-architecture support (amd64, arm64, armv6l, armv7l, i386)
  - Multi-platform support (Linux, macOS)
  - Automatic GOPATH setup and PATH configuration
  - Shell profile integration
- **Rust**: Installs latest stable Rust via rustup
  - Includes essential components (clippy, rustfmt)
  - Automatic PATH configuration
  - Shell profile integration
  - Keeps toolchain up to date

## 📊 **Benefits of Consolidation**

### **Efficiency Gains**
1. **Single execution**: One script instead of two
2. **Shared setup**: Common logging, error handling, and utilities
3. **Reduced redundancy**: Eliminates duplicate functionality
4. **Better resource usage**: More efficient PATH and environment management

### **Maintenance Benefits**
1. **Single source of truth**: One file to maintain
2. **Consistent error handling**: Unified approach across all operations
3. **Better testing**: Easier to test and validate all functionality
4. **Documentation**: Self-contained with built-in help

### **User Benefits**
1. **Simplified workflow**: One command for complete setup
2. **Better feedback**: Clear indication of what's happening
3. **Recovery options**: Backup and retry capabilities
4. **Flexibility**: Command line options for different scenarios

## 🔄 **Migration Path**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Replace both scripts** with the new `setup.sh`
2. **Update documentation** to reference the new script
3. **Test in non-production environment** first

### **Backward Compatibility**
The new script provides all functionality from both original scripts, so no features are lost.

### **File Structure**
```
zsh/
├── setup.sh              # New unified script
├── initial_setup.sh       # Can be deprecated
├── configuration_files.sh # Can be deprecated
└── ... (other files remain unchanged)
```

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **Complete Setup**
```bash
# Full setup including packages and configuration
./setup.sh

# Setup with existing config file protection
./setup.sh --force
```

### **Selective Setup**
```bash
# Only install packages, skip configuration
./setup.sh --skip-config

# Only deploy configuration, skip packages
./setup.sh --skip-packages

# Minimal setup (useful for containers)
./setup.sh --skip-packages --skip-config
```

### **Development Workflow**
```bash
# Safe config update (creates backups)
./setup.sh --skip-packages

# Force config refresh
./setup.sh --skip-packages --force
```

## 📋 **Operation Phases**

1. **Package Installation**: System packages via apt
2. **Directory Setup**: Create and configure directories
3. **User Groups**: Add user to necessary groups
4. **Python Environment**: Install and configure pyenv
5. **Go Installation**: Install latest Go version with architecture detection
6. **Rust Installation**: Install latest Rust/Rustup with components (clippy, rustfmt)
7. **Go Tools**: Install Go-based tools (asdf, pdtm)
8. **Node.js Environment**: Setup Node.js and npm packages
9. **Oh My Zsh Installation**: Install Oh My Zsh framework (ZSH users only)
10. **Configuration Deployment**: Copy and configure shell files
11. **System Configuration**: Apply system-level settings
12. **PATH Update**: Update current session PATH

## 🔍 **Error Recovery**

The script provides detailed recovery information:
- **Backup locations**: Shows where backups were created
- **Failed operations**: Lists what failed and why
- **Recovery commands**: Suggests specific actions to fix issues
- **Log file location**: Points to detailed logs for troubleshooting

This consolidation provides a much more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly setup experience while preserving all original functionality.
